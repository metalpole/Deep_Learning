This repository contains my code as part of the assignments for the deep learning specialization by deeplearning.ai. The learning material as part of the Jupyter notebooks are provided by deeplearning.ai through Coursera. Although the fundamentals of neural networks are not new to me, I enrolled in this course mainly because I wanted to learn how to implement machine learning techniques using Python (previous learning was done in MATLAB). 

This course serves as a good exercise for me to: 1) Practice Python programming 2) Familiarize myself with Python packages such as numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn 3) Understand the foundations of deep learning 4) Build functions to implement vectorized neural networks from scratch.
